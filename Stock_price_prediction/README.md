# LSTM-Stock-Price-Prediction
This is to predict the upwards and downwards trend of stock price using LSTM-based models. 

The first model is trained using the Open price from 2012-01-03 to 2017-12-29, and to predict Open price.

The second model is trained using 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume', 'Close' and to predict Close price.

The conclusion is in the parts of prediction which contain spikes, the model lags behind the actual prices, but in the parts that contain smooth changes, the model manages to follow upwards and downward trends. 

******Production level codes are now updated for the first model. ENJOYðŸ’•ðŸ’•******

******Dockerfile and Flask API dev are to be updated. Stay tuned ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž******
